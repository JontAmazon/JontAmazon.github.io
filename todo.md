# Prio 1
- increase size of LinkedIn and GitHub icons? Consider adding them to the Header.
- Hero page: try adding an image of myself
  - I dont like how the "Hero" page looks now. Hm...
  - I COULD remove it alltogether and replace it with one that I make.
- make APPLE DASH look nicer.

# Prio 2
- recruiters might not click my links. So what can I do to make it look impressive without them doing that?
  - MAYBE I can re-organize it and make it look like https://dunks1980.com/
  - use modals?
    - (masters thesis and acceleration ball)

# Prio 3
- possible to lazy-load "Jonatan Lindholm", one letter after another?

# LATER consider (a lot of work):
- consider:
    - add "University Projects/Specialization":
    - intro = text about what courses/topics I found most interesting.
        I specialized in numerical methods for solving mathematical problems.
    - Master's Thesis
    - fun projects:
        - (Optimization Mini Project)
        - let GPT briefly explain: line search, barrier and penalty constraints
        - GitHub repo: function-optimizer-newtons-method-with-line-search
        - GitHub repo: function-optimizer (penalty/barrier functions)
        - GitHub repo: heat-equation-2D-mpi
        - (Ice and Snow (albedo))
    - consider adding "Learning Projects":
    - SQL
    - Playwright Practice
    - consider adding "Fun Projects":
    - yatzy solver
- Consider expanding the About section:
  I have a background in physics, numerical methods, vad mer? ... fortsätt här.
  (if I do this, also consider adding that to my cover letter.)


# EV:
- different background color?

# EVEV:
- Header: instead of "About" and "Projects", I could have "Home", and I could make the whole Header clickable? But in this case, maybe I cannot have h1 text in the Header zone, which I currently have.
