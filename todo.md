# Prio 1
- migrate!
- did migration fix project links?





# Prio 2
- should I keep favicon?
- recruiters might not click my links. So what can I do to make it look impressive without them doing that?
  - consider making it look more like https://dunks1980.com/
  - for Apple Dash, consider including a small image of the 
  - for Acceleration Ball, consider... hm... idk.
- dev tools: any errors?
- I dont like how the "Hero" page looks.
  - image of myself?
  - increase size of LinkedIn and GitHub icons? Consider adding them to the Header.





















# Later consider - GitHub Actions for automated builds:
https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/ -> "Configure a GitHub Actions"
- note if I do this: I should do:
  1. git rm dist/
  2. re-add dist/ to .gitignore



# Later consider
- possible to lazy-load "Jonatan Lindholm", one letter after another?
- use modals?
  - instead of /subpages, I could use modals for master's thesis and acceleration ball! Much nicer UX. Inspired by https://dunks1980.com/
- re-order projects? : Acceleration Ball - Apple Dash - Playwright Practice - Master's Thesis
- different background color?

# LATER consider:
- consider:
    - add "University Projects/Specialization":
    - intro = text about what courses/topics I found most interesting.
        I specialized in numerical methods for solving mathematical problems.
    - Master's Thesis
    - fun projects:
        - (Optimization Mini Project)
        - let GPT briefly explain: line search, barrier and penalty constraints
        - GitHub repo: function-optimizer-newtons-method-with-line-search
        - GitHub repo: function-optimizer (penalty/barrier functions)
        - GitHub repo: heat-equation-2D-mpi
        - (Ice and Snow (albedo))
    - consider adding "Learning Projects":
    - SQL
    - Playwright Practice
    - consider adding "Fun Projects":
    - yatzy solver
- Consider expanding the About section:
  I have a background in physics, numerical methods, vad mer? ... fortsätt här.
  (if I do this, also consider adding that to my cover letter.)




# EVEV:
- Header: instead of "About" and "Projects", I could have "Home", and I could make the whole Header clickable? But in this case, maybe I cannot have h1 text in the Header zone, which I currently have.
