# Prio 1

# Consider adding "University Projects":
- intro = text about what courses/topics I found most interesting.
    I specialized in numerical methods for solving mathematical problems.
- list of projects:
    - (Optimization Mini Project)
      - brief explanation of line search, barrier and penalty constraints.
    - GitHub repo: function-optimizer-newtons-method-with-line-search
    - GitHub repo: function-optimizer (penalty/barrier functions)
    - GitHub repo: heat-equation-2D-mpi
    - (Ice and Snow (albedo))

# EV:






# EVEV:
- different background color?
- make APPLE DASH look nicer?
- possible to lazy-load "Jonatan Lindholm", one letter after another?


# GOLDPLATING:












# NJA:
- Header: instead of "About" and "Projects", I could have "Home", and I could make the whole Header clickable? But in this case, maybe I cannot have h1 text in the Header zone, which I currently have.
- recruiters might not click my links. So what can I do to make it look impressive without them doing that?
  - MAYBE I can re-organize it and make it look like https://dunks1980.com/, i.e. a 2x2 grid with one project per cell. Each project has an image that fades. Zoom in on image on hover.
  - use modals? Applicable to masters-thesis and acceleration-ball.
- consider adding "Learning Projects":
  - (SQL)
  - Playwright Practice
- consider adding "Fun Projects":
  - yatzy solver
- Consider expanding the About section:
  I have a background in physics, numerical methods, vad mer? ...
  ... men njaa, kan skriva om detta i introt till "University Projects" ist√§llet.
