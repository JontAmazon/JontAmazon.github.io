### About me

My name is Jonatan, I was born in 1995 and grew up in Stockholm. Between 2015-2020 I studied Engineering Physics at Lund University.
In September 2020 I started to learn German. In May 2021 I obtained a B2-level German certificate from the Goethe Institute, and in September I moved to Germany to work as a Python developer at the German Aerospace Center, developing simulations of concentrated solar power plants.
In 2022, I returned to Lund and worked as a Test Engineer at Axis Communications for two years.
Now, I'm excitedly looking for a new commitment, preferably near Lund.
