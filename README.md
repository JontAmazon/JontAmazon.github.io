### About me

My name is Jonatan, I was born in 1995 and grew up in Stockholm.
In 2015 I moved to study at Lund University, and in 2020
I graduated with a degree in Engineering Physics.

Currently (summer of 2020), I'm enjoying life, getting
into shape and pursuing some smaller projects while planning my future,
such as where I would like to work as a graduate.
