### About me

My name is Jonatan, I was born in 1995 and grew up in Stockholm.
At 20 years old I moved to study at Lund University and in 2020
I graduated with a degree in Engineering Physics.

Currently, during the summer of 2020, I'm enjoying life, getting
into shape and pursuing some smaller projects while planning my future,
such as where I would like to work as a graduate.
