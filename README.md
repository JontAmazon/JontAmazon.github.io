### About me

My name is Jonatan, born in 1995. In 2020 I graduated from Lund
University with a degree in Engineering Physics.

Currently, during the summer of 2020, I'm enjoying life, getting
into shape and pursuing some smaller projects while planning my future,
such as where I would like to work as a graduate.
