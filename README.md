### About me

My name is Jonatan, I was born in 1995 and grew up in Stockholm. Between 2015-2020 I studied Engineering Physics at Lund University. \
In September 2020 I started to learn German. In May 2021 I obtained a B2-level German certificate from the Goethe Institute, and in September 2021 I moved to Cologne, Germany, to work as a Python developer at the German Aerospace Center, developing simulations of concentrated solar power plants. In August 2022 I moved back to Lund to look for a new commitment, probably within programming.
